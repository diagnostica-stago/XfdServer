# XfdServer

A project to get your build statuses from TeamCity and display them on a Led Display (this project is made for the Mc Crypt 590996).

Config for the TeamCity server and connection to the display is in XfdServer/app.config, the config for the builds to watch is in xfd.xml

The LedScroller part is heavily based on [Xtreme Feedback](http://www.ziegelmeier.net/extreme-feedback-device) by Dirk Ziegelmeier.
